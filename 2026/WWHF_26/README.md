# Wild West Hackin' Fest 2026

The biggest security conference in Colorado this year put on by Black Hills Security

Lots of AI talks this year and a lot of concern about the role of LLMs in cyber.
This was underlined by one of the ctf winners letting agentic workflows solve the CTF for them.
Counterbalanced by the badge CTF being won by non-llm users. Definitely shows the limitations.

I was able to stay in the top 100 (94) of the introductory CTF. Mostly focused on reverse
engineering and cryptography.
