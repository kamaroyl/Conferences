# Job hunt like a hacker

Speaker: Jason Blanchard

LinkedIn --> OSINT
People Tab --> look up recruiters
   Show all posts, recruiters are chronically online
   

Recommend Michel Khan OSINT class

5 Phases
- Where do you want to work
- Create a tailored resume
- Apply at the company's website
- Find an internal advocate at the company
- Track all information
  - Who you talked to
  - When you talked to them

Use LLMs
Prompt: Give me a list of companies in Location that needs profession and are thriving in the current economy/has growth opportunities
(recconaissance)

Think of dream employers, list in priority
Actively look for jobs while employed

Build a network

Giving talks is the easiest way to meet a whole bunch of people

don't say no on behalf of someone else

Create a tailored resume for each of the companies

Don't use resume templates(?)

Humans suck at describing themselves, they are better at finding things that describe them
A resume is "Tell me abouut yourself in a way that will feed you and your family"

Best way to make a resume
- Find the job(s) you want
- look for jobs with your current role, use the requirements in your resume
  - 2 hour window, look over all job posts and find every bullet point that applies to you
Feed a link to your degree to an llm and have it spit out what you would have learned over that course

APPLY AT THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE
It's a real job (hopefully)
Find the JOB ID
Create an email account just for job hunting!
Make an association with the email account, e.g. "name_role@gmail.com"

Find people on LinkedIn associated with that role (recruiters). Look for open messages

Why I am reaching out (use job id)
Who I am
Why I care
What I want
How to reach
